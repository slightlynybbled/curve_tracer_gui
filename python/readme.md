# Running This Program #

This is *un-tested* on linux, but there is nothing too exotic going on, so I
expect there to be some issue somewhere, but I am not sure what that issue
will be.

## With Python 3 Installed ##

### Setup ###

Install Python 3.  At this time, there is no support for Python 2.  I imagine
that getting Python 2 support is trivial, I just don't want to do it and I 
feel that the community as a whole is moving to v3.

    pip install serialdispatch
    
or

    pip3 install serialdispatch

### Running ###

Execute the application with the python interpreter:

    python app.py
    
or

    python3 app.py
